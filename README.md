# Women Who Code Pensacola
Women Who Code: Pensacola Chapter

Join us on [Meet Up](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Pensacola/)

### Who We Are
Women Who Code (WWCode) is a U.S. based 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. We connect amazing women with other like minded amazing women around the globe who unite under one simple notion â€“ the world of technology is much better with women in it.

### Resources
Folder for us to list resources, guides, open source projects we are working on, or anything that might be useful for the Pensacola network.

There is a Women Who Code national organization github where generic resources, i.e. coding tutorials, guides, belong. This space is for Pensacola specific projects or anything that isn't nationally related once we get going.
